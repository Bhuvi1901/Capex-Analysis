# CapEx Planning and Resource Allocation Analysis

## Overview

Analyzed capital project spending data to predict budget variance. The project aims to enhance financial planning and resource allocation in capital-intensive projects.

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Loading and Cleaning
- Imported capital expenditure datasets containing planned vs actual costs for various projects.
- Handled missing values, dropped irrelevant features, and standardized column formats for analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Analysis
- Generated plots to compare planned and actual costs, highlighting variance trends across departments.
- Correlation matrices were used to identify cost drivers and variance predictors.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Created new features such as cost ratio, time deviation, and project complexity score to explain cost overruns better.
- Performed feature selection using mutual information and Random Forest importance.

### 4. Model Development
- Trained XGBoost and Linear Regression models to predict cost variance (numerical target).
- The XGBoost regressor was fine-tuned using grid search, achieving strong R² scores and low MAE.

### 5. Data Visualization
- Developed an interactive [Power BI dashboard]('https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b1fb610-3626-47ca-a7c7-6b7b3aec66c0') to analyze:
     - Capital expenditure data across 100+ projects, showcasing total budget, actual expenditure, and active project count.
     - Highlighted key insights such as phase-wise budget vs. expenditure, percentage variance detection using DAX, and project overrun/underrun classification across 
            Execution, Closure, and Planning stages.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

## Output

The XGBoost regression model achieved a mean absolute error of 6,103 and an R² score of 0.93, indicating strong predictive capability and high accuracy in forecasting project cost overruns.
